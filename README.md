# REQUIREMENTS SATISFIED:

The **home page** specifies an overview of your business, the products you sell, the management team, and any other information that you think makes sense for the customers to know about your company.  <br />
The **product page**, which can be navigated to from the navigation bar at the top of the page, lists of products (at least 10) available for sale in a table with multiple rows and column, where each product is shown within a separate cell.  <br />
The **product page** displays an image for each product available for sale in each cell.  <br />
The **product page** displays the price and other key information (e.g., color, material, etc.) associated with each product in the corresponding table cell.  <br />
The user is be able to choose a product by clicking on the corresponding image, which leads to a new page that provides additional details about the product  <br />
The **product page** provides the ability to track the mouse movement, such that when the mouse moves over a product image, the size of the image is increased and rotates, and when the mouse moves out, the size of the image is returned back to normal. <br />
On the the **cart page**, which can be navigated to from the navigation bar at the top of the page, the user is able to order a product by filling a form. The form should allow the user to enter the product identifier, quantity, first name, last name, phone number, shipping address, shipping method (e.g., overnight, 2-days expedited, 6-days ground), and credit card information.  <br />
Upon submitting the form, the website sends an email with the purchase order information included in the body of the email.  <br /> 
Before submitting the form, it checks for proper formatting, including whether all fields are filled properly, whether the phone number, address, and credit card are properly formatted. An alarm is raised if a field is empty or not properly formatted to prevent submission of bad data.  <br />
Our website uses CSS to specify at least 10 stylistic properties for our website <br />

And of course our names located on the **home page**
